# 🎉 COMPLETE FIX - All Issues Resolved

## 📋 Issues Fixed (Based on Your Requirements)

### ✅ 1. Bus Number Inconsistency Fixed
**Problem**: Database had `SIET--005` (double dash) but routes defined as `SIET-005` (single dash)

**Solution**: 
- Exported `normalizeBusNumber()` function from `locationService.js`
- Converts `SIET--005` → `SIET-005` automatically
- Applied in: MapScreen.js, BusDetails.js, all location services

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/locationService.js` - Exported normalization function
- `src/screens/MapScreen.js` - Added normalization in loadRouteStops()
- `src/screens/BusDetails.js` - Added normalization in getRouteStops()

---

### ✅ 2. Track Live Button Fixed
**Problem**: Button navigated to non-existent screen `'BusLiveTracking'`

**Solution**: Changed to navigate to `'MapScreen'` with correct params

**File Modified**:
- `src/screens/BusDetails.js` line 168
- **OLD**: `navigation.navigate('BusLiveTracking', { bus: bus })`
- **NEW**: `navigation.navigate('MapScreen', { busId: bus.number, role: 'management' })`

---

### ✅ 3. Attendance History Fixed
**Problem**: Firebase composite index error when querying with `where()` + `orderBy()`

**Solution**:
- Removed `orderBy('date', 'desc')` from Firebase query
- Sort records in JavaScript after fetching: `records.sort((a, b) => b.date.getTime() - a.date.getTime())`
- Limit to 60 records using `.slice(0, 60)`

**File Modified**:
- `src/screens/AttendanceHistoryScreen.js`
- Removed: `orderBy('date', 'desc'), limit(60)` from query
- Added: JavaScript sorting and slicing

---

### ✅ 4. Student Feedback System Created
**NEW FEATURE**: Complete feedback and complaint system

**Features**:
1. **Student Side** (FeedbackScreen.js):
   - 5 Categories: General, Bus Issue, Driver, Route/Time, Safety
   - Text input for detailed feedback
   - View previous feedbacks with status
   - See management responses

2. **Status System**:
   - 🟡 **Pending**: Waiting for management review
   - 🟠 **Acknowledged**: Management has seen it
   - 🟢 **Resolved**: Issue fixed

3. **Response Display**:
   - Students see management's response
   - Shows responder name and timestamp
   - Highlighted response box with icon

**Files Created**:
- ✅ `src/screens/FeedbackScreen.js` - Complete feedback UI

**Files Modified**:
- ✅ `src/screens/StudentDashboard.js` - Added "Feedback & Complaints" button
- ✅ `src/navigation/AppNavigator.js` - Added FeedbackScreen to navigation
